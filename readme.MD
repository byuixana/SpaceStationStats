# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

I wrote a data analytics program that examines and compares data from the Celetrak space station documentation. Each graph compares data from the group of stations, or a selected station

I built this software to help people see a visiualization of the oeprations of space stations and the different ways they findtion.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I would like to fix the x axis of my mean motion graphs.
- I would like to check and make sure the future positions formula is correct. 
- I would like to make it so the csv file is updated daily.
